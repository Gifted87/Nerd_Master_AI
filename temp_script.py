if __name__ == "__main__":
    document_title = "the_effects_of_ai_on_our_daily_lives"
    create_ai_effects_document(document_title)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Import `Document` from `docx`:**
    ```python
    from docx import Document
    ```
    This line imports the necessary `Document` class from the `python-docx` library, which is used to create and manipulate Word documents.

2.  **Define `create_ai_effects_document` function:**
    ```python
    def create_ai_effects_document(filename):
        # ... function code ...
    ```
    This defines a function that encapsulates the logic for creating the document. It takes the `filename` (without the extension) as input.

3.  **Create a `Document` object:**
    ```python
    document = Document()
    ```
    This line creates an instance of the `Document` class, which represents the Word document we are going to build.

4.  **Add Title using `add_heading`:**
    ```python
    document.add_heading('The Effects of AI on Our Daily Lives', level=1)
    ```
    -   `document.add_heading()` adds a heading to the document.
    -   The first argument is the text of the heading: `'The Effects of AI on Our Daily Lives'`.
    -   `level=1` specifies that it's a top-level heading (like Heading 1 in Word).

5.  **Add Paragraphs using `add_paragraph`:**
    ```python
    document.add_paragraph(""" ... text ... """)
    ```
    -   `document.add_paragraph()` adds a paragraph of text to the document.
    -   We use triple quotes (`"""Docstrings"""`) to create multi-line strings for the content, making the code more readable for longer paragraphs.
    -   The code adds several paragraphs explaining different aspects of AI's effects, organized with headings for better structure (e.g., "Key Areas of Impact", "Work and Employment", etc.).

6.  **Use Heading Levels for Structure:**
    ```python
    document.add_heading('Key Areas of Impact', level=2) # Heading 2
    document.add_heading('Work and Employment', level=3) # Heading 3
    ```
    We use `level=2` and `level=3` to create headings of different levels, visually structuring the document like you would in a typical Word document using heading styles.

7.  **Save the Document using `document.save()`:**
    ```python
    document.save(f"{filename}.docx")
    ```
    -   `document.save()` saves the created `Document` object to a `.docx` file.
    -   `f"{filename}.docx"` uses an f-string to dynamically create the filename using the input `filename` and adding the `.docx` extension.

8.  **Print Success Message:**
    ```python
    print(f"Word document '{filename}.docx' created successfully.")
    ```
    This line provides confirmation that the document has been created.

9.  **`if __name__ == "__main__":` Block:**
    ```python
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        document_title = "the_effects_of_ai_on_our_daily_lives"
        create_ai_effects_document(document_title)
    ```
    -   This is a standard Python construct that ensures the code inside this block only runs when the script is executed directly (not when it's imported as a module into another script).
    -   `document_title = "the_effects_of_ai_on_our_daily_lives"` sets the desired filename (without extension).
    -   `create_ai_effects_document(document_title)` calls the function to create the document with the specified title.

**Before Running:**

-   **Install `python-docx`:** If you haven't already, you need to install the `python-docx` library. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    pip install python-docx
    ```

**How to Run:**

1.  Save the Python code as a `.py` file (e.g., `create_word_doc.py`).
2.  Run the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python create_word_doc.py
    ```
3.  After running, you will find a Word document named `the_effects_of_ai_on_our_daily_lives.docx` in the same directory as your Python script. Open this file to see the generated document.
